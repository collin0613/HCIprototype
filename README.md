Our HCI prototype utilizes Google Chrome Extension capabilities and front-end programming.
This extension will be applied to a student email interface and incorporate features that
aim to improve how efficiently college students find important emails in a spammed inbox.


Study Design:
Participant Pool 
We want to keep our focus exclusively on students at Stevens Institute of Technology for our study. We aim to recruit 15-20 participants by sending out targeted emails and/or reaching out personally. Since our primary goal is to improve the email system based on personally specific problems faced by our campus community, we want to ensure we get a diverse and representative sample of students across different majors and years of study.

Study Design
For our study, we're going with a within-subjects design, which means each participant will get to interact with both the current email platform AND our redesigned prototype. 
This approach is great because it controls for individual differences between participants and lets us make direct comparisons between the two systems since everyone tries both.

Procedure
Each participant will complete the same set of common email-related tasks in an identical email inbox across both systems.
All participants will perform these tasks in a controlled setting using their email platform with and without the Chrome extension. 
To make sure we're being methodologically sound, we'll counterbalance the order of conditions (current platform vs. redesigned prototype) to minimize any order effects.

Each participant will experience two blocks of three trials on each system. 
We will tell the user to identify and open emails fitting under different categories that the extension will allow sorting for, and compare efficiency with and without the prototype.

Measurable Variables
We'll be measuring several key variables to compare the systems:
Task completion time (quantitative): Measured in seconds to compare efficiency between the systems, where tasks are opening a specific email
Perceived usability (both qualitative and quantitative): Using the System Usability Scale after each condition
User satisfaction and preference (qualitative): Gathering feedback through open-ended interview questions and Likert scale survey responses about comfort levels, frustration points, and overall impressions
We've chosen these particular measurement methods because they give us a perfect combination of objective metrics and subjective user perceptions.
This way we can capture both the effectiveness of our design AND the overall user experience, which are the two central pillars of what we're trying to evaluate in HCI.
